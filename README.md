- **Real-time Detection**: Monitors network traffic for SYN floods, UDP floods, HTTP floods, and other attack patterns
- **Machine Learning**: Uses multiple ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) for accurate attack classification
- **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful real-time dashboard with live statistics and alerts
- **REST API**: Complete API for integration with other systems
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates for monitoring dashboards
- **Automatic Mitigation**: Configurable mitigation actions for detected attacks
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for high-performance network monitoring
- **Multiple Versions**: Standalone, Simple, and Full versions for different use cases
 
## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- No admin privileges required for Standalone and Simple versions

cd DDoS-Detection-and-Mitigation-System

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the full system
python run_system.py
```

### Access Dashboard
- **Standalone Version**: http://localhost:8002 (Recommended)
- **Simple Version**: http://localhost:8001
- **Full Version**: http://localhost:8000

## Testing the System

To verify everything works correctly:

```bash
# Test the standalone version
python test_final_system.py

# Test individual components
python quick_test.py
```

## System Components

### Standalone Version (Recommended)
- `standalone_dashboard.py` - All-in-one solution with detector and dashboard
- `final_launcher.py` - Ultimate launcher with all improvements
- No separate processes needed - everything runs in one application
- Works without admin privileges
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8002

### Simple Version
- `simple_detector.py` - Working detector with simulated data
- `simple_dashboard.py` - Web dashboard (no admin required)
- `run_fixed_system.py` - Easy launcher for the working version
- Uses simulated network data
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8001

### Full Version (Advanced)
- `ddos_detector.py` - Core detection engine with real packet capture
- `web_dashboard.py` - Full web interface and API
- `ml_trainer.py` - ML model training
- `run_system.py` - System launcher
- Requires admin privileges for packet capture
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8000

### Core Detection Engine
- Real-time packet capture using Scapy
- Statistical analysis of network traffic
- Rule-based attack detection
- ML model integration for classification

### Web Dashboard
- FastAPI-based web interface
- Real-time statistics and charts
- Attack alerts and notifications
- Configuration management
- WebSocket for live updates

### ML Training
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Multiple ML model training
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Model persistence and loading

## Attack Detection

The system detects various types of DDoS attacks:

### SYN Flood
- **Detection**: High SYN packet rate with low SYN+ACK ratio
- **Threshold**: Configurable packet rate and ratio thresholds
- **Severity**: High

### UDP Flood
- **Detection**: High UDP packet rate with minimal TCP traffic
- **Threshold**: Configurable packet rate and UDP ratio
- **Severity**: High

### HTTP Flood
- **Detection**: High HTTP request rate from limited sources
- **Threshold**: Configurable request rate and source count
- **Severity**: Medium

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unicode/Emoji Errors**: If you see encoding errors, the system will work but without emoji characters
2. **Port Already in Use**: Try a different port or stop other services
3. **Permission Denied**: Use the Standalone or Simple versions (no admin required)
4. **Dependencies Missing**: The system will automatically install them

### Getting Help

- Check the logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- For Windows: Run PowerShell as Administrator if using Full version
- For testing: Use the Standalone version (recommended)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
```python
attack_thresholds = {
    'syn_flood': {'packet_rate': 1000, 'syn_ratio': 0.1},
    'udp_flood': {'packet_rate': 2000, 'udp_ratio': 0.8},
    'http_flood': {'packet_rate': 500, 'http_ratio': 0.9}
}
```

### ML Models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Network (MLP)

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats` - Current network statistics
- `GET /api/alerts` - Recent attack alerts

### Configuration
- `POST /api/config` - Update detection thresholds
- `POST /api/mitigate` - Apply mitigation actions

### WebSocket
- `ws://localhost:8000/ws` - Real-time updates

## 🚨 Mitigation Actions

The system supports various mitigation strategies:

- **IP Blocking**: Block malicious source IPs
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limits to suspicious traffic
- **Traffic Redirection**: Redirect traffic to honeypots
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers

## 📈 Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
- Packets per second
- Unique source/destination counts
- Protocol ratios (SYN, UDP, HTTP)
- Connection statistics
- Attack confidence scores

### Alerts
- Real-time attack notifications
- Severity classification
- Source and target identification
- Confidence scoring

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Network Access**: Requires elevated privileges for packet capture
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data is stored or transmitted
- **Resource Usage**: Monitors system resources to prevent overload
- **False Positives**: Configurable thresholds to minimize false alarms
